# PRD — Flyboy Videography Client Portal

## Original problem statement
Connect the project to the user's existing Supabase database (NO MongoDB). Use the
publishable/anon key client-side, secret/service_role key server-side only. RLS on
every table with client data so no client can query another client's records.
Fresh app: client portal for a videography business (Flyboy Videography, UK/GBP).

## Architecture
- Frontend: React (CRA) + Tailwind, supabase-js (anon key) for auth + direct
  RLS-protected reads/writes; axios → FastAPI for profile ensure / seed / admin ops.
- Backend: FastAPI (port 8001, /api prefix) using supabase-py with the
  SERVICE_ROLE key (server-only, in backend/.env). Verifies Supabase JWTs via
  auth.get_user(). Deliberately bypasses RLS for admin operations.
- Database: Supabase Postgres. Schema + RLS in /app/supabase_schema.sql —
  USER RUNS IT MANUALLY in the Supabase SQL Editor (declined to share DB
  connection string).

## Tables (all with RLS)
clients, bookings, retainer_subscriptions, deliverables, review_threads, invoices.
- Admin model: clients.role ('client'|'admin'); SECURITY DEFINER helpers
  public.is_admin() and public.current_client_id(); every policy is
  "own rows OR is_admin()". Clients cannot self-assign admin (insert/update
  policies pin role='client').
- Admin bootstrap: backend ADMIN_EMAILS env var auto-promotes on /api/clients/ensure,
  or manual UPDATE in SQL.
- invoices: exactly-one-of booking_id/subscription_id check; currency default GBP;
  client_id ON DELETE RESTRICT (UK financial record retention / GDPR Art. 17(3)).
- review_threads UPDATE policy: author_user_id = auth.uid() (clients can only
  update their own comments — fixed after user review, 2026-06).

## Implemented (June 2026)
- Full schema + RLS SQL file (user-reviewed, 3 fixes applied: review_update policy,
  GBP default, invoice delete restrict; renamed Frame&Form → Flyboy Videography).
- Auth: email/password via Supabase Auth; login/signup page.
- Pages: Dashboard (stats + demo seed), Bookings (list + request form),
  Retainers, Deliverables (list + detail with video embed, timestamped review
  thread, resolve toggles, final file link), Invoices (booking vs retainer badges),
  Admin console (client picker, create booking/sub/deliverable/invoice, status updates).
- Backend: /api/health, /api/clients/ensure, /api/me, /api/demo/seed,
  /api/admin/* (clients, overview, bookings, subscriptions, deliverables, invoices).
- Graceful "schema not run yet" handling (503 + frontend banner).

## Pending / blocked on user
- User must run /app/supabase_schema.sql in Supabase SQL Editor (not done as of last session).
- Email confirmation still enabled in Supabase project (user said they'd disable).

## Backlog
- P1: Stripe payments/webhooks for invoices (user mentioned as backend purpose).
- P1: File upload for final deliverables (Supabase Storage).
- P2: Email notifications on new cuts/comments.
- P2: GDPR erasure flow (anonymize client, keep invoices).
